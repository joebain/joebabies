ideas:

simple braitenburg like behaviour from the snake, it acts differently to the four different colours (these could be actual things even).

so eg snake avoids red and white (but white maybe gives it a powerup, extends the body!), seeks blue and black but black kills it if it gets too cose for too long. in this case the player should only be able to move the red and blue blocks, black and white are static and give the challenge

world and snake movement should be clear and marked but snake should have a degree of 'aliveness'

game also takes place in three dimensions, snake goes over blocks (good or bad idea? 3d is pointless if not)

perhaps make blocks look more stackable and let the player easily move them around to influence th snake.

how about time dilation blocks? sticky ceiling blocks, switches, moving floors etc

can the snake move blocks? i think not

and the aim is to ? play a game of snake, reach an exit, collect all white blocks on a level i think the last is decent.
