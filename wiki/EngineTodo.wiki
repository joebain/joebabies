  * ~~Fix the 'stuff doesn't appear bug' - Very important~~ - done!
  * ~~Sound and music~~ - done!
  * Animation for objects and sprites
  * ~~Transparency for 2D sprites~~ ~~(actually its not quite working)~~ it is, it was just lighting problems which are now fixed
  * ~~2D text (for huds)~~
  * ~~Skybox~~ kind of done, not exactly beautiful and ~~floors~~ ~~(improvements are happening with the floors)~~ floors are so done!
  * ~~Timing - make each call to 'step()' pass the amount of intervening time~~ done!
  * Make sure all the things in the world are operating with the same coords
  * Maybe quarternion rotations (yeah right)
  * Maybe some anti aliasing or toon shading - something to make it look nice
  * Improve the camera - less rigid / fixed
  * ~~Make it possible to press forward and left at the same time~~
  * Come up with some way of using lua to script the animals behaviour
  * Make the grass dance
