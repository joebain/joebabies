==This is a broad outline of the engine==

There are a few objects that we only have one of:
  * *World* - controls behaviour, links things together
  * *Display* - coordinates opengl starting and displaying of objects
  * *BlockFactory* - create blocks with this
  * *Camera* - controls the viewpoint, can be set to follow a block3d
  * *LuaBinder* - just hides away all the lua bindings

There are also blocks:
  * *Block* - abstract base
  * *Block3D* - represents a 3d object in the world, must be textured
  * *Block2D* - yes 2d objects. mainly these are designed to be displayed against the screen as sprites. must have a texture and can have texture with transparent bits
  * *Sky* - one of these, inherits from block3d
  * *Floor* - again one, inherits from block3d too
  * *Block2DText* - inherits from block2d but shows text rather than a picture

There are several dull bits too:
  * *VectorNx* - vectors for strong positions and rotations and doing maths
  * *Obj*[ects] - store the 3d data for a model
  * *Texture* - store bitmap data for a texture
  * *Face*, *Vertex* - components of an Obj
  * *Timer* - keeps the time
  * *ModelLoader* - loads in a .obj file
