## Ideas about the game ##

So there are no hard and decided things about the game but I will basically lay out my idea as far as I have one.

### Story ###

You have just got a job as IT support at the zoo, it is you task to go round the zoo and help all the animals out with their IT problems. But one day the internet falls from the sky with pieces crashing all round the zoo. Of course your bosses blame you so you must get all the pieces back and restore the internet. Many of the pieces of the internet are inside the cages with the animals and because the internet has fallen from the sky none of the electronic door locks work, so you need the help of the animals to get the internet back.

### Gameplay ###

So after mine and Steve's brain storm (thought shower?) we are perhaps a bit closer to an actual game idea.

Each 'level' should consist of a cage with animals inside. Each animal has a set of actions it can do, specific to that kind of animal. The ideas for animal so far are:
  * Gorilla - Can climb trees and smash boxes with his big gorllia fists.
  * Beaver - Can swim and cut down trees.
  * Parrot - Can fly (i.e. is not blocked by normal obstacles) and pass instructions on to other animals.

We also talked about animals being limited in the directions they can move, like chess pieces essentially. A gorilla can move like a rook, a beaver like a queen, the parrot is completely free.

The game will be puzzley, you can get round the outside of a cage and call the animals to you, but they can only travel in their restricted straight / diagonal lines. Once they are at the side of the cage (assuming they can get there, they are not blocked by an obstacle) you can speak to them and give them instructions. The instructions basically have two components: a direction and an action. The animal will then go in that direction and perform that action if appropriate, for example you can tell a gorilla to go forward and climb. He will walk (stroll? gambol?) forward and if he comes across a tree he will climb it.

In this way you can direct the animals and the puzzles revolve around using the animals in the right order and with the right instructions. Me and Steve came up with two possible levels. See the pictures below:

### Conclusion ###

By combining simple instructions and the different skills the animals have to to be guided to the pieces of the internet (and possibly bring them back to you). I imagine it would play a bit like Chu Chu Rocket.
